I'm that <mark>JS</mark> enthusiast who love to tinker around, shedding a tear or cracking a smile in the world of JavaScript. When boredom strikes, I like to build something cool. You can also find me rockin' the role of organizer at <a href="https://www.commudle.com/communities/gdg-new-delhi" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GDG New Delhi</a>. And hey, when I'm not coding, catch me playing chess or badminton!

## Tech Stack

I'm all about trying out new JS tools, keeping my stack fresh but currently I am playing with...

- React/Next.js (and ecosystem)
- Svelte/SvelteKit (Current ðŸ’›)
- Node.js
- Bun.sh (Current ðŸ’›)
- ElysiaJS/Hono
- TypeScript
